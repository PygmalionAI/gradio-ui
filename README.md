**DEPRECIATED**:

This is a prototype Gradio-based UI which allows you to chat with the [Pygmalion models](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI).

We provide a notebook which directly interacts with this code in our repo, which can be found [here](./notebooks/GPU.ipynb). The notebook can either be run locally or can be used on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PygmalionAI/gradio-ui/blob/master/notebooks/GPU.ipynb).
